# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Description

Here at Flowbox we help our clients gather content from Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and
other social media platforms that can then be displayed as a Flow(s) on our clients websites.
Displaying that content in a visually appealing manner is important for us and our clients. Your
task is to fetch content (photos) from an API (you don’t need to load real data from
Instagram/Facebook/Twitter but instead you should mock the server call) and display that
content in several different layouts (Grid, Carousel/Slider, and Cards). We recommend using
React to build a web app (as we use it for our product) and TypeScript (if you know TS) that will
fetch photos and information from an API. The app should display photos and descriptions of
each photo. The user should be able to switch layout between a list view, grid view and carousel
view.


Objectives

● Create a custom hook to fetch content (photos) from an API using Fetch AP (or mocking
these calls with some predefined data).
● Store data from API in a global state using Context API, Redux, MobX, Zustand, or
whichever state management method you prefer.
● Provide a way for the user to select the manner in which the content (photos) will be
displayed (Grid, Carousel/Slider, list view and Cards). You don’t need to do it manually,
and using third-party library(ies) is totally fine. See examples on the second page.
● User should be able to quickly change between these three different layout types
● Be sure to include unit testing using Jest and React Testing Library.
● Create a github repo containing your app and share the link in an email once you have
completed the task.
